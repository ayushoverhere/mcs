# 🔥Modern Cipher Solver
It can solve some of the most common cypher like Caesar cipher and Rail Fence cipher with encryption and decryption function. I tried my best efforts to handle incorrect input, and some errors, and I always wanted to have a optimised version of the program so that it will take less time and less memory.

# ðŸ”¥Modern Cipher Solver
It can solve some of the most common cypher like the Caesar cipher and Rail Fence cipher with encryption and decryption functions. I tried my best efforts to handle incorrect input and some errors, and I always wanted to have an optimised version of the program so that it would take less time and less memory.

# Caesar Cipher
A Caesar cipher is a simple method of encoding messages. It is a type of substitution cipher in which each letter in the plaintext is replaced by a letter some fixed number of positions further down the alphabet.

# Rail Fence Cipher
The Rail Fence cipher is a transposition cipher consisting in writing a text in zig-zag and reading it in a straight line.

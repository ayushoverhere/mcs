# ðŸ”¥Modern Cipher Solver
It can solve some of the most common cypher like the Caesar cipher and Rail Fence cipher with encryption and decryption functions. I tried my best efforts to handle incorrect input and some errors, and I always wanted to have an optimised version of the program so that it would take less time and less memory.

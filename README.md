# ðŸ”¥Modern Cipher Solver
It can solve some of the most common cypher like the Caesar cipher and Rail Fence cipher with encryption and decryption functions. I tried my best efforts to handle incorrect input and some errors, and I always wanted to have an optimised version of the program so that it would take less time and less memory.

# Caesar Cipher 
A Caesar cipher is a simple method of encoding messages. It is a type of substitution cipher in which each letter in the plaintext is replaced by a letter some fixed number of positions further down the alphabet.

# Caesar Cipher History and Aplications
"Caesar Cipher," is one of the earliest known ciphers. Developed around 100 BC, it was used by Julius Caesar to send secret messages to his generals in the field.
While Caesar's was the first recorded use of this scheme, other substitution ciphers are known to have been used earlier. Julius Caesar's nephew Augustus also used the cipher, but with a shift of one:
Caesar ciphers can be found today in children's toys such as secret decoder rings. A Caesar shift of thirteen is also performed in the ROT13 algorithm, a simple method of obfuscating text used in some Internet forums to obscure text , but not used as a method of encryption.

# Rail Fence Cipher
The Rail Fence cipher is a transposition cipher consisting in writing a text in zig-zag and reading it in a straight line.
